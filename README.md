  <h2>
    Why I created Moobie? ü§ì
  </h2>
  <p>
    My main motive was to learn server-side rendering in Next.js and how it differs from client-side rendering. Creating a clean UI/UX web application is my hobby, and what I wanted was to provide content to users without any annoying ads and pop-ups.

    Open for new ideas. ü´°

## Workflow of moobie.
There is a backend that is scraping a website for the desired details; most of the complexity is working behind the UI. The backend is merged with a consumetApi to retrieve streaming links and show them to the user.
- Backend
  - Scraping a website to retrieve desired details such as image source, title, etc.
  - Collecting them into an array of objects.
  - Creating a route that returns those details.
  - Creating the backend was a new experience for me, but it felt kind of easy, though not entirely.
  - The main issue I encountered was during deployment üòÖ.
  
- Frontend
  - Yellow theming, as I am not a great UI designer, but I still managed to make it look aesthetic and clean with full screen responsiveness.
  - A good-looking landing page for new users to understand briefly why I created Moobie.
  - I personally love to add the toggle theming from `dark` to `light`, with the default being `system`.
  - I mostly used SSR, which conveniently hides the API calls in the network section. Somehow, I loved this.

> I'm not sure if you should clone it or not since it uses the scraper I created. But if you're interested in learning how UI/UX works, then go for it.
